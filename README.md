My name is Someshwar Hande and this is my Very first Html Project
This is an IT Coaching Class Website which is made using Html, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
If you want to make to see this project work there are few thinks to do :
1. crete two folder inside any folder, the name of the file must be "static" and another files name must be "templates".
2. Inside the template folder save all the html files.
3. And the rest will go inside the static folder and now you can run it
